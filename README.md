# Prints

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/meetup/prints.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/meetup/prints)

a [jwt](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32) finger printer

## background

[jwt](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32) evolved out of a family of web oriented specfications targeting the second major version of oauth, [oauth2](http://oauth.net/2/) as a means of encoding structured data in a compact and tamper-proof format.

In short, jwt defines a standard means of signing arbirary data in JSON format.

## install

At the following to your sbt project's `build.sbt`

```scala
resolvers += "softprops-maven" at "http://dl.bintray.com/content/softprops/maven"

libraryDependencies += "me.lessis" %% "prints" % "0.1.0"
```

## usage

A jwt token is made up of 3 parts. A (JOSE) [header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32#section-5) declaring information about how verify the signature of a set of claims, a set of [claims](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32#section-4) this can actually be any arbitrary JSON data, and a signature, generated with a private key using a method specified in header information.

### headers

The only required property of a header is a signing algorithm identifier. This library current supports "none" (no signing), "HS256" (HmacSHA256), "HS384" (HmacSHA384), "HS512" (HmacSHA512), "RS256" (SHA256withRSA), "RS384" (SHA384withRSA), and "RS512" (SHA512withRSA). There's room to support more. Feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/softprops/prints/pulls) and do so!

```scala
val header = prints.Header("HS256")
```

### claims

Claims represent some metadata meant for passing between two parties. In practice this can be any arbitrary data. Prints provides factory methods for creating sets of claims from simple `String` key-value pairs or a `org.json4s.JValue` value.

```scala
val simpleClaims = prints.Claims(
  "foo" -> "bar"
)
```

```scala
import org.json4s._
import org.json4s.JsonDSL._
val complexClaims = prints.Claims(
  ("foo" -> "bar") ~
  ("nbf" -> notBeforeTimestamp) ~ 
  ("scope" -> List("read", "write"))
)
```

Because claims can contain arbitrary constraints, a `prints.Claims` instance provides a simple
query interface with a few typed helpers. A primative query method `get` defined as

```scala
def get(f: JField => Boolean): Option[JValue]
```

provides a base for typed helpers like `str` (returns option of String), `long` (returns option of Long), `seconds` returns a finite duration representing seconds. This typed query methods are all implemented in terms of `get`.

```scala
val bar = complexClaims.str("foo") // Some("bar")
val scopes = complexClaims.get(_ match {
  case ("scope", JArray(_)) => true
  case _ => false
}).collect {
  case JArray(scopes) => for {
    JString(scope) <- scopes
  } yield scope
} // Some(List("read", "write"))
```

### making tokens

Given a `Header`, set of `Claims` and a private key you can then create a signed token. The type of header algorithm used dictates the type of key used
to sign a set of claims. An `HS*` header can be signed with an `Algorithm.Key.Bytes` key and a `RS*` header can be signed with an Algorithm.Key.Rsa` key.

The result is an `Option` type because a header-defined signing algorithm may not be supported

```scala
val token: Option[Array[Byte]] =
  prints.JWT(header, claims, prints.Algorithm.Key.Bytes("secret".getBytes))
```

A valid result can then be safely used for HTTP or other transports. The result is URL safe so no additional encoding is required.

```scala
token.map(new String(_)) // eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmb28iOiJiYXIifQ==.88HN1LmGMYQTD4CYwnOoM9EqFWqSv6G1kkGI0EjNOmA=
```

### consuming (validating) tokens

Prints provides an extractor for jwt strings that unpacks the token into the 3 canonical parts. A `Header`, a `Claims` set, and a string signature

```scala
val jwt = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmb28iOiJiYXIifQ==.88HN1LmGMYQTD4CYwnOoM9EqFWqSv6G1kkGI0EjNOmA="
val decoded = jwt match {
  case prints.JWT(header, claims, sig) =>
    // to application specific validation
  case _ => None
}
```

You can verify jwt tokens in two forms by supplying a string jwt and key or the tuple of unpacked components and key. For former is useful if you 
know the key a head of time, otherwise you may more commonly derive a key to verify based on the `aud` of the claim, in which case you need to first
unpack the jwt components. In each case the result is Option of the unpacked contents of the jwt

```scala
val validated: Option[(Header, Claims, Array[Byte])] = prints.JWT.verify(jwt, algo, key)
```
